    <h2>🙋🏼‍♂️ Target Audience</h2>
    <h2>Description of target audience</h2>
    <p>My target audience is Rock Climbers wanting to go on trips or learn more about specific climbing areas. As I mentioned on my home page, the only way to get further information about a climbing area is through a book or a deep search on the internet. </p>
    <h2>Two personas</h2>
    <p>The two personas I want to be coming to this website and who it's targeted at are Recreational and Professional Rock Climbers or people just getting into climbing and wanting to go somewhere for it. I want a broad audience, but if I'm being candid, not many new people looking to get into climbing are planning trips to different parts of the united states just for climbing. So most of these people will be recreational and professional rock climbers, which allows me to use rock climbing-specific words.</p>
    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <p>The scenarios that I think someone will come to my website are
        <br> 1. A rock climber wanting to research a rock climbing area
        <br>  2. A rock climber planning their next trip and wondering where to stay and where to climb
        <br> 3. A rock climber wondering what equipment is needed for them to climb the walls
        <br> 4. A rock climber wondering what the policies are of a particular place for camping
        <br> 5. A rock climber wondering how much money it is to climb an area
        <br> 6. A rock climber wondering where to get there</p>
