    <h2>🙋🏼‍♂️ Target Audience</h2>
    <h2>Description of target audience</h2>
    <p>My target audience is local business owners in Cottonwood Heights who promote not only their business but their city and the activities they have surrounding their city. </p>
    <h2>Two personas</h2>
    <p>The two personas I want to be coming to this website are people thinking of moving to Cottonwood Heights and starting a business and current business owners in Cottonwood Heights. I also would like to have heads of charities and other people involved in their community come to this site and see other people that are involved and basically create a small network of a community.</p>
    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <p>The scenarios that I think someone will come to my website are
      <br> 1. Business owners want to attend and advertise at events.
      <br> 2. Business Owners wanting to give back to their community
      <br> 3. Someone may want to see upcoming events
      <br> 4. Help people understand the demographics and statistics of the city
      <br> 5. Join and be more involved in the community </p>
