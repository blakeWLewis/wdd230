                        <p>To give some background, Kiln is a modern workplace in Lehi, Utah. They focus on tech and tailoring to developers and small start-ups. I found their website very good at using alignment. They use vertical and horizontal alignment in certain parts of their website. I think it speaks volumes about making their website clean and polished. They also utilize videos and pictures on their website, which I think brings a lot of variety to their website and content. When trying to sell offices, it is important to show variety while also staying organized because your message gets across to the user. </p>

                    <h3>Apple</h3>
                    <div class="box-website-link">
                        <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-14-pro/">Apple.com</a>

                    <div>
                        <p>Apple is arguably one of the best design companies of our life times. From the beginning, Apple has been known as the best UI and UX interface! Their website with the new iPhone is no different. You get the feeling of a slick design and a futuristic phone using white space and clean design. This is intentional because, as a UX designer, the space you have speaks volumes if you want something to feel new and cool. In addition, they are trying to convey that the phone is easy to use while having the most advanced tech in the phone. If there were tons of things on this website, you wouldn't believe the message they're trying to convey that the iPhone 14 is simple and easy to use. Overall I think their design helps the user understand their product, gives an overall clean, simplistic design to the website, and improves overall focus. </p>

                <div class="box-body">
                    <h3>Stance</h3>
                    <div class="box-website-link">
                        <a href="https://www.stance.com/">stance.com</a>

                    <div>
                        <p>I think Stance is one of the best websites at Visual Hierarchy. Even though they sell socks, underwear, and hats, I believe Stance has done a great job making their website look good and professional. In addition, I heard the CEO speak at a tech conference and talk about how design is the lifeblood of good technology. The fonts they use coincide so well together, and the font sizes they use are perfect for what they're trying to emphasize, which is what Visual Hierarchy is all about. The text and the layout of their webpage lets more prominent information stand out to the user. </p>
